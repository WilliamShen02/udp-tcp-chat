# TCP/UDP Chat Application
## Weilong Shen @ Georgia Tech

Welcome to the UDP/TCP Chat Application project!

To begin, please download the executable files first. You will need a Linux environment to run them since they are not in the .exe format.

### Application Download

There are two pairs of client-server applications. One is implemented using TCP sockets and the other using UDP sockets. Please use them accordingly since, for example, a UDP client cannot work with a running TCP server.  
Here are the TCP server: (link) and the TCP client (link) applications.  
Here are the UDP server: (link) and the UDP client (link) applications.

After downloading the executable files, please look at the instructions for use as follows.
